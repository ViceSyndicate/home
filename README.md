### Victor S

Welcome to my portfolio.

# I'm a software developer with a background in IoT which means I worked on everything from small devices out in the world that help society 
# run smooth and safe to how information is presented in order to allow people to make the right decisions. 

# Whether it be when the washing machine should automatically turn on to minimize energy costs or when authorities should be alerted about a discrepancy in our water pipes.
